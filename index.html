<h2 class="titles-green">Who are we?</h2>

    <p>We are a "semi-company", who wants to clean up the litter that has been put <em>everywhere</em>, and also earn from helping the entire world!</p>
    <p>If picking up litter had a reward, then it could be massive! Rewards make our monkey brains go <b>bananas</b> (pun intended)!</p>

    <h2 class="titles-green">Rewarding litter-picking</h2>
        <p>In some nordic countries, they have introduced a concept known as: Panting!
        Panting is taking a material, and recycling it (turning garbage or old objects into new, usable material) and getting money, or a coupon from it!</p>
        <p>Sweden, Norway, Finland and some other places have started making panting a thing!
        The most common "pant" are bottles or cans!</p>
        <p>Every bottle or can that can be panted has a little design on it! They could vary based on the country of origin (the image below has a swedish icon).</p>
